# Spacefighters

Spacefighters is a video game created with SFML/C++ which takes inspiration from the arcade game Space Invaders. 

Shoot all monsters and use the asteroids to hide from the monsters' attacks.

The game is compiled with GCC and you can run the compiled game in the build folder (spacefighters.exe).

If you want to compile the game yourself, you need to use the provided GCC compiler in the toolchain folder. You also need to adjust the CMakeLists.txt file and point the SFML_DIR variable to the correct location.
